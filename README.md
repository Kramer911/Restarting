Starting to sharpen my skills

I am trying like a mad man to get the text and image from the landing page to stay side by side while being responsive. I know I am more than likely
just missing one line of code to make that happen. Even in school when we only had float and nothing flex, grid, column(had to us TD's, TR's) related even existed,
it was the bane of my existence.
